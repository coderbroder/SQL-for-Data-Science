Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_attribute
		From attribute;
ii. Business table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_business
		From business;
iii. Category table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_category
		From category;
iv. Checkin table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_checkin
		From checkin;
v. elite_years table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_elite_years
		From elite_years;
vi. friend table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_friend
		From friend; 
vii. hours table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_hours
		From hours;
viii. photo table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_photo
		From photo; 
ix. review table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_review
		From review; 
x. tip table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_tip
		From tip; 
xi. user table = 10000
	Select Count(*) as count_user
		From user;
	

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
	Select Count(Distinct id)
		From business;
ii. Hours = 1562
	Select Count(Distinct business_id)
		From hours;
iii. Category = 2643
	Select Count(Distinct business_id)
		From category;
iv. Attribute = 1115
	Select Count(Distinct business_id)
		From attribute;
v. Review = 10000 (id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
	Select Count(Distinct id)
		Count(Distinct business_id), 
		Count(Distinct user_id)
		From review;
vi. Checkin = 493
	Select Count(Distinct business_id)
		From checkin; 
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
	Select Count(Distinct id)
		Count(Distinct business_id)
		From photo;
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id) & 3979 (business_id)
	Select Count(Distinct user_id),
	Count(Distinct business_id)
		From tip; 
ix. User = 10000
	Select Count(Distinct id)
		From user; 
x. Friend = 11
	Select Count(Distinct user_id)
		From friend; 
xi. Elite_years = 2780
	Select Count(Distinct user_id)
		From elite_years;

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City - Edinburgh
Category - Nightlife

Businesses:
Mood - 2.0 star rating
Miros Cantina Mexicana - 4.0 star rating

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes    
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

It appears that Edinburgh’s restaurants and nightlife are in the same neighborhood, New Town. Restaurants in New Town appear to close when Nightlife opens. New Town seems like a more popular neighborhood than Leith based on the number of reviews.

SQL code used for analysis:

Select business.name,
		business.city,
		category.category,
		business.stars,
		hours.hours,
		business.review_count,
		business.neighborhood
		From (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id) 
			INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = category.business_id
			Where business.city = 'Edinburgh' 
 				Group By business.stars;
				

+------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| name                   | city      | category    | stars | hours                | review_count | neighborhood |
+------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| Mood                   | Edinburgh | Nightlife   |   2.0 | Thursday|22:30-3:00  |           11 | New Town     |
| A & A Traders          | Edinburgh | Shopping    |   3.5 | Saturday|9:00-18:00  |            6 | Leith        |
| Miros Cantina Mexicana | Edinburgh | Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|12:00-22:30 |           37 | New Town     |
+------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The businesses that are still open have more reviews.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The businesses that are still open are open at a later time.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select business.name,
		business.is_open,
 		category.category,
		business.stars,
 		hours.hours,
		business.review_count,
 		business.neighborhood
			From (business INNER JOIN category on business.id = category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = category.business_id
				Where business.city = 'Edinburgh' 
 					Group by business.is_open;

+------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| name                   | is_open | category    | stars | hours                | review_count | neighborhood |
+------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| Mood                   |       0 | Nightlife   |   2.0 | Thursday|22:30-3:00  |           11 | New Town     |
| Miros Cantina Mexicana |       1 | Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|12:00-22:30 |           37 | New Town     |
+------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Analyzing the most unsuccessful category of businesses.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will need to look at the businesses average rating and the number of businesses that exist in each category. I will reasonably assume less than or equal to a 2.0 star rating is an unsuccessful business in this analysis (based on the previous questions in this assignment). From the output, we notice that these categories generally a low number of reviews (with the exception of Dance Clubs). Furthermore, there is only 1 business in each category. We could infer that 1 business in a category with the lowest ratings is considered “unsuccessful” in this database. It is worth to note that there are 4 categories in this analysis that are associated to transportation services. Businesses associated with Banks & Credit Unions and Day Spas had the lowest rating.
 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+--------------------------+--------------+-----------+--------------+
| category                 | num_business | avg_stars | review_count |

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT category.category, 
       count(business.id) num_business, 
       avg(business.stars) avg_stars, 
       business.review_count
		FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id)
			GROUP BY category.category
				HAVING avg_stars <= 2
					ORDER BY avg_stars ASC
